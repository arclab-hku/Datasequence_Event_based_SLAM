# Results (raw trajectories) of our methods

</div>

Since our source code is only internal-accessed and not publicly available, we release the results of our methods, including the estimated 6-DoF pose and the ground truth, in the form of `rosbag`. We strongly recommend the peers evaluate their proposed works using our [dataset](https://github.com/arclab-hku/Event_based_VO-VIO-SLAM) and do the comparison with the raw results from our methods using their own accuracy criterion.
